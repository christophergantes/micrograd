# Micrograd

## Description
This is an autograd library based off the one made by Andrej Karpathy. This exists for merely educational purposes and teaching myself low-level programming.

## Plans
Here are some things I plan to do to make this stand out from Karpathy's project
- Add more testing: Adding test can improve future changes and add reliability to any refactoring done in the future.
- Add integration with C or Rust to speed up certain processes.
